# Fun with Giphy's API
![Gif](/assets/gif.gif)

This project accesses Giphy's API. The two functions of this application allow the user to search for gifs based on the keyword used and it saves the search(es) in the form of a button(s).

I was motivated to create this application because I'm always searching for gifs to use, and I wanted to work with an API. I really enjoyed this first attempt at working with an API. 

For future development of this project, I would like to add some polishing with CSS and more innate UI features.

No dev dependencies or npm packages require.
