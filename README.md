Fun with Giphy's API

!(Giphy)(gif.gif)

This project accesses Giphy's API, so that you can search for gifs based on your keyword search, 
and save those searches in the form of a button.

The application is working, but still needs some finishing CSS touches and UI features.

No dev dependencies or npm packages require.
